Dependencies Need:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install gym
pip install matplotlib
```

To set up virtual environment:
```bash
qlearning_env\Scripts\activate # ON WINDOWS
source qlearning_env/bin/activate # ON LINUX
```
- I'm unsure if this works as of right now, need to check after the raspberry pi integration
